# nbastats

<p>nbastats is a Flask-based web application that uses D3.js and nvd3.js in addition to py_goldsberry and nba_py libraries in order to graphically represent NBA player statistics over their careers. pylibmc was used to cache the large amounts of data collected, and pandas was used to organize said data.
